# Power-BI

# Components to Power BI:

Power BI Desktop (desktop application)
Power BI service (online platform)
Power BI Mobile (cross-platform mobile app)

# What is Power BI
-Power BI Desktop is the development tool available to data analysts and other report creators.
- Power BI service allows you to organize, manage, and distribute your reports and other Power BI items.
- Power BI Mobile allows consumers to view reports in a mobile-optimized format.

# The flow of Power BI is:

*Connect to data with Power BI Desktop.
*Transform and model data with Power BI Desktop.
*Create visualizations and reports with Power BI Desktop.
*Publish report to Power BI service.
*Distribute and manage reports in the Power BI service.

-The building blocks of Power BI are semantic models and visualizations.
# semantic model
-A semantic model consists of all connected data, transformations, relationships, and calculations.
# How to create semantic model?
- To follow the flow of Power BI, you first connect to data, transform data, and create relationships and calculations to create a semantic model.
  # When creating a report, it is important to:
  *First, connect to as many data sources you need.
  *Then clean and transform the data to your needs.
  *Add relationships between tables and calculations to extend the semantic model.
  *After all of that, now you can create a report.
  
# visualizations in a report
-In Power BI Desktop, when you create a visualization (also called visual), you add it to the canvas for a report page.
-Choose your visualizations to build pages in your report.

# Power BI main areas

-Ribbon - Displays common tasks that are associated with reports and visualizations.
-Report view, or canvas - Where visualizations are created and arranged. You can switch between Report, Data, and Model views by selecting the icons in the left column.
-Pages tab - Located along the bottom of the page, this area is where you would select or add a report page.
-Visualizations pane - Where you can change visualizations, customize colors or axes, apply filters, drag fields, and more.
